## Branch naming convention
Since there is no jira to keep track of events in development. The branching strategy is 3-digit number in incremental order followed by description.

`001-readme-for-reference`

Commits should have the branch number and br suffixed, followed by description.

`001br: basic documentation done`

## How often would be the updates
Hopefully regularly, but slowly and steadily we'll reach the goal.
